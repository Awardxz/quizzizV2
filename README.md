I genuienly made this because its the safest method so far. 
Maybe in the future i will improvise add highlighting and stuff but for the moment it works.
Just open console, execute this and it will print the answers out.
Works by fetching answers from a api by also getting the pin code from a class in the website.
Then we can easily just catch and bingo.
