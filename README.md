# quizizzV2.5

## New Update #1
A new branch has been created for QuizizzV2.5. This version now uses its own built API from the quizizzSoft project.

## New Update #2
Version quizzizV2.5.
Highlighting Added.

## How it works
1. Open the console.
2. Execute the provided script.
3. The script will print the answers by fetching them from the new quizizzSoft API and obtaining the pin code from the class on the website.

This method is undetected and works seamlessly.

### TODO:
Future improvements may include adding highlighting and other features, but for now, it works effectively.
